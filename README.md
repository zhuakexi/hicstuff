A lightweight library that generates and handles Hi-C contact maps in either CSV or [instaGRAAL](https://github.com/koszullab/instaGRAAL) format. It is essentially a merge of the [yahcp](https://github.com/baudrly/yahcp) pipeline, the [hicstuff](https://github.com/baudrly/hicstuff) library and extra features illustrated in the [3C tutorial](https://github.com/axelcournac/3C_tutorial) and the [DADE pipeline](https://github.com/scovit/dade), all packaged together for extra convenience.

## Installation

To install a stable version:
```sh
   pip3 install hicstuff
```

or, for the latest development version:

```sh
    pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/koszullab/hicstuff.git@master#egg=hicstuff
```

If you want to upgrade hicstuff, you can use:

```sh
 pip3 install --upgrade hicstuff
```
Note for OSX and BSD users: `hicstuff pipeline` relies on the GNU coreutils. If you want to use it, you should use these as your default. [Here](https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/) is a tutorial to set the gnu coreutils as default commands on OSX. 

## Usage

### Full pipeline

All components of the pipelines can be run at once using the `hicstuff pipeline` commands. This allows to generate a contact matrix from reads in a single command. By default, the output sparse matrix is in GRAAL format, but it can be a 2D bedgraph file if required.

    usage:
        pipeline [--quality_min=INT] [--duplicates] [--size=INT] [--no-cleanup]
                 [--threads=INT] [--minimap2] [--bedgraph] [--prefix=PREFIX]
                 [--tmpdir=DIR] [--iterative] [--outdir=DIR] [--filter]
                 [--enzyme=ENZ] [--plot] --fasta=FILE
                 (<fq1> <fq2> | --sam <sam1> <sam2> | --pairs <bed2D>)

    arguments:
        fq1:             Forward fastq file. Required by default.
        fq2:             Reverse fastq file. Required by default.
        sam1:            Forward SAM file. Required if using --sam to skip
                         mapping.
        sam2:            Reverse SAM file. Required if using --sam to skip
                         mapping.
        bed2D:           Sorted 2D BED file of pairs. Required if using
                         "--pairs" to only build matrix.


    options:
        -b, --bedgraph                If enabled, generates a sparse matrix in
                                      2D Bedgraph format (cooler-compatible)
                                      instead of GRAAL-compatible format.

                                      "-e" to be a restriction enzyme, not a
                                      chunk size.
        -S, --sam                     Skip the mapping and start pipeline from

        fragments_list.txt: information about restriction fragments (or chunks)
        info_contigs.txt: information about contigs or chromosomes

### Individual components

For more advanced usage, different scripts can be used independently on the command line to perform individual parts of the pipeline.

#### Iterative alignment
Truncate reads from a fastq file to 20 basepairs and iteratively extend and re-align the unmapped reads to optimize the proportion of uniquely aligned reads in a 3C library.

                                         column, as generated by hicstuff
                                         pipeline.
        -l, --log                        Log transform pixel values to improve

                                         in PNG format.
        -r STR[;STR], --region=STR[;STR] Only view a region of the contact map.
                                         Regions are specified as UCSC strings.
                                         (e.g.:chr1:1000-12000). If only one
                                         region is given, it is viewed on the
                                         diagonal. If two regions are given,
                                         The contacts between both are shown.

                                         matrix if the sum of their contacts
                                         deviates from the mean by more than
                                         INT standard deviations.


For example, to view a 1Mb region of chromosome 1 from a full genome Hi-C matrix rebinned at 10kb:

`hicstuff view -n -b 10kb -r chr1:10,000,000-11,000,000 -f fragments_list.txt contact_map.tsv`

### Library

All components of the hicstuff program can be used as python modules. See the documentation on [reathedocs](https://hicstuff.readthedocs.io). The expected contact map format for the library is a simple CSV file, and the objects handled by the library are simple ```numpy``` arrays. The various submodules of hicstuff contain various utilities.


```python
import hicstuff.digest # Functions to work with fragments (digestion, matrix building)
import hicstuff.iteralign # Functions related to iterative alignment
import hicstuff.hicstuff # Contains utilities to modify and operate on contact maps as numpy arrays
import hicstuff.filter # Functions for filtering 3C events by type (uncut, loop)
import hicstuff.view # Utilities to visualise contact maps
```

### Connecting the modules

All the steps described here are handled automatically when running the `hicstuff pipeline`. But if you want to connect the different modules manually, the intermediate input and output files must be processed using light bash scripting.

#### Extracting contacts from the alignment
The output from iteralign is a SAM file. In order to retrieve Hi-C pairs, you need to run iteralign separately on the two fastq files and process the resulting alignment files processed as follows using bedtools and some bash commands.

1. Convert the SAM files into BED format

```bash
samtools view -bS -F 260 -@ $t -q 30 "for.sam" |
  bedtools bamtobed -i - |
  awk 'OFS="\t" { print $1,$2,$3,$4,$6 }' \
    > contacts_for.bed

samtools view -bS -F 260 -@ $t -q 30 "rev.sam" |
  bedtools bamtobed -i - |
  awk 'OFS="\t" { print $1,$2,$3,$4,$6 }' \
    > contacts_rev.bed
```

2. Put all forward and reverse reads into a single sorted BED file

```bash
sort -k1,1d -k2,2n contacts_for.bed contacts_rev.bed \
  > total_contacts.bed

```

#### Attributing each read to a restriction fragment
To build a a contact matrix, we need to attribute each read to a fragment in the genome. This is done by intersecting all the reads with the digested genome.

1. Extract restriction fragments from the genome using `hicstuff digest`.

```bash
# Generate fragments_list.txt
hicstuff digest --fasta genome.fa \
  --enzyme DpnII \
  --output-dir .

# Make a BED from it
awk 'NR>1 { print $2"\t"$3"\t"$4"\t"(NR-2) }' fragments_list.txt
  >fragments_list.bed

```

2. Intersect the BED files of reads and restriction fragments.

```bash
bedtools intersect -a total_contacts.bed \
  -b fragments_list.bed -wa -wb |
  sort -k4d  \
  > contact_intersect_sorted.bed

```
4. Get reads into a paired BED file (1 pair per line)

```bash
# Note: F is fragment and R is read
# This awk snippet allows to convert a sorted BED file with fields:
#   Rchr Rstart Rend Rname Rstrand Fchr Fstart Fend Fidx
# to a "2D BED" file with:
#   F1chr F1start F1end F1idx R1strand F2chr F2start F2end F2idx R2strand
bed2pairs='
BEGIN{dir="for"; OFS="\t"}

```
The resulting 2D BED file can then be filtered by the `hicstuff filter` module if needed, otherwise, the matrix can be built directly from it. To generate a GRAAL-compatible sparse matrix from the 2D bed file:

```bash
# Remove strand information, sort by fragment combination,
# Count occurrences of each fragment combination and format into csv.
echo -e "id_fragment_a\tid_fragment_b\tn_contact" > matrix.tsv
cut -f4,9 "$tmp_dir/contact_intersect_sorted.bed" |
  sort -V |
  uniq -c |
  sed 's/^ *//' |
  tr ' ' '\t' |
  awk '{print $0,$1}' |
  cut -f1 --complement >> matrix.tsv
```

### File formats

* 2D BED: This is the input format for `hicstuff filter`. It has one line per Hi-C pair and the following fields for each read: **chr start end name frag_id strand**.
* 2D bedgraph: This is an optional output format of `hicstuff pipeline` for the sparse matrix. It has two fragment per line, and the number of times they are found together. It has the following fields: **chr1, start1, end1, chr2, start2, end2, occurences**

* GRAAL sparse matrix: This is a simple CSV file with 3 columns: **id_a, id_b, occurrences**. The id columns correspond to the absolute id of the restriction fragments (0-indexed).
